Through the application of prompt engineering methodologies and sentiment analysis, we'll figure out if sentiments expressed by users for our courier services are Positive or Negative. This will help us understand where we need to improve in order to meet customer expectations and keep them happy. With a focus on getting better all the time, we'll overcome the challenges at ExpressWay Logistics and make our services the best."

        "### Results and Conclusions\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Model Observations\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **LLM prompts produce \"fuzzy\" results. Approach with caution.** I noticed that even when specifying a binary classification with deterministic values, the nature of the model produced variable outputs. Spurious characters are produced which artificially degrade model results. _The F1 scores above contain a downward bias_ i.e. the models actually perform better than the code suggests. Even if the model correctly classified the review as negative it produced the label \"Negative.\" which is computationally distinct from the ground truth label \"Negative\".\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Careful prompt construction and/or post-processing is required to get at true performance.** A better choice of labels and limiting the response to one token would alleviate the fuzzy results problem. For example, {-1, 1} would be preferred as a result. For a binary classifier this is ideal as the meann can quickly demonstrate overall sentiment. However, here the models clearly were taking a more nuanced take on classification, stubbornly but correctly classifying reviews as \"Mixed\" or \"Neutral.\" In my view this makes GPT3.5 on its own, a bad choice for binary classifiers of text like this. We can post-postrocess to \"cast\" then into binary results but before doing so we should note what percentage of this out of band results are and act accordingly.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Obviously zero shot underperforms few shot.** The prompt is more constrained with more context for the LLM to complete the task. Here the F1 score doubles from a deeply underperforming model to one with reasonable performance. I would regard an F1 score 0.81 as indicating a good but not great model. It is good enough to say general things about customer sentiment. \"We have too many negative reviews.\" It is not good enough in my view to make super specific claims about sentiment. \"We are net positive 4% on total reviews.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **It was possible to make a zero shot model perform equally to a few shot with the right prompt.** As I iterated on my prompts looking at the results, I was able to tweak them to the point where they performed (F1 score) identically to the few shot example prompts. This has implications for efficiencies in operations but also risks. I wouldn't recommend it for anything but a binary classifier.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Business Observations\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **General conclusions are better than nothing and that can be enough to get started.** The old adage still applies: Know your customer. While I wouldn't depend on these models to tell me the exact figures, they provide me with plenty of important insights. For example, there are too damn many negative reviews! ExpressWay Logistics has problems that need to be addressed.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **A lot more fine grained analysis needs to be done.** This binary classifier is more of a quick, back of the envelope bit of analysis. What really needs to be done is:\n",
        "    - **Let the LLM do it's job and classify things correctly as it wants.** If a review is \"Mixed,\" it's mixed! It's neither positive or negative but both. It makes no sense to throw away results you paid dearly for that can drive important insights. Azure is not free! You need to understand your customer! \n",
        "    - **We need to have multi-class classification along multiple dimensions.** Even if we could perfectly classify reviews as positive or negative, we would still have no clue what these reviews are about. What kind of problem did the customer have? Late delivery? Damaged product? On the other hand, how did we delight them? What do they love about ExpressWay? We have no idea what problems to address nor what we should emphasize to improve customer experience."
